Covid-19 vaccinations on US data.

Since the COVID vaccine was created, much data has been collected. The data ranges from how many people have been vaccinated, the rate of vaccination, and how has COVID subsided since the vaccine rollout. Many people tend to underestimate or overestimate the impact COVID has had worldwide, thus it is important to highlight the data to the worldwide audience but we have focused on the US. This data will help businesses and governments predict when they can start operating businesses with less restrictions, reopening schools, and transitioning to live similar to pre-covid.
